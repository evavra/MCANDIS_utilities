MCANDIS is an acronym for Matlab Code for Atmospheric Noise Depression through Iterative
Stacking, a method for mitigating the atmospheric noise in InSAR analysis proposed by Tymofyeyeva and Fialko (2015). The basic idea of this method is similar to stacking, which assumes that the atmospheric perturbations are random in time, so the atmospheric noises can be reduced by stacking many interferograms. MCANDIS is a Matlab version of this algorithm.

These codes facilitate the processing of GMTSAR-formatted files through Kang Wang's (UC Berkeley) implementation of MCANDIS.
